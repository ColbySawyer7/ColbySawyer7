# Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Colby!

Welcome to my GitHub profile. I'm a passionate developer currently diving into the worlds of Rust, Python, Machine Learning, AI, and IoT. Feel free to explore and reach out if you'd like to collaborate!

ðŸ”­ Currently, I'm involved with [PITON](https://pitoncloud.org) and [ECU-Sensing](https://github.com/ECU-Sensing) which is now operated by the [Center for IoT Engineering and Innovation](https://cet.ecu.edu/ciei/).

ðŸ’¬ Let's [work together](https://colbysawyer7.github.io/) on new ideas!

## Fun Fact

In my spare time, I love to create and bring to life unique designs through 3D printing. I really love to tinker with all types of projects and its nice to get my hands "dirty"!
